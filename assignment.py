# Ask Nabiha to input her salary for the month.
# Ask Nabiha to input the name of the month she is storing the salary for.
# Ask Nabiha to input the following percentages for: a) Savings b) Rent c) Electricity

#The script should calculate and display:

# The amount allocated to savings, rent, and electricity.
#The total amount Nabiha spends on savings, rent, and electricity combined.
# The remainder of Nabihaâ€™s salary after these expenses.
# The monthly rent and electricity multiplied by 12 to estimate Nabiha's yearly rent and electricity costs.
# Nabiha's total salary for the month raised to the power of 2 (just for fun).
# Assume Nabiha saves an additional random amount (e.g., $50) each month, and you need to calculate how much would be left if this amount is divided by the total amount allocated to savings.
# I will use functions to calculate the above values.
# then I will store the data in list of months
